Hello world!

I am Mando and I am a junior Data Scientist in a company based in Brussels, Belgium. This blog was made for the purposes of trying to become better at
putting my thoughts into writing. The goal will be towards Data Science topics, talks, snippets and many more things I am interested in.
That is to say `statistics`, `optimization algorithms` and `graphs`. These are the building blocks to a lot of the algorithms we have at our disposal
in scikit-learn and on other packages. 


In the future I intend to also write about deep learning and neural networks in general, but that day is far from now as I: 
1. my experience with them is almost $$\delta$$, 
2. they feel a bit rushed when I still do not have a conceptual grasp of the basics just yet.
