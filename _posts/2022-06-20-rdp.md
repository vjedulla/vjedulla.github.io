One of the most predominant data sources out there are timeseries or geometrical data (i.e. 2D GPS sensors). 
These data are often noisy and need a bit of preprocessing to be fully interpretable. Today I will be showing the
usage of a very simple but powerful algorithm that is designed to simplify line segments, be that of a timeseries
or vector paths. This is useful when the data has a lot of discrepancy or noise, or simply you need to lower the 
resolution of your data. There is usually no need to have 100k 2D points in a 10m line segment, you can get away with 
less than 1k and keep a high fidelity of your data. 

The method is known as Ramer–Douglas–Peucker algorithm, usually abbreviated as `rdp`. This algorithm takes in one argument 
`epsilon`. This parameter can be thought of as a maximum distance that we need 
to filter out points on the path. The animation, which comes from the wikipedia article, shows how does the algorithm 
decides which points to keep or not in a given path.

There is a small useful implementation in python of this method and you can find it 
[here](https://pypi.org/project/rdp/){:target="_blank"} (also the [docs](https://rdp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/){:target="_blank"}).
