There are some type of biases that are not well known but affect almost every measurement due to the 
proportion of the population being sampled. For example, how long do you usually wait at the bus stop 
for your bus? If the schedule is at 15 minutes, on average you need to wait 7-8 minutes as its assumed 
that you arrive in the time between these 15 minutes. This is not what you observe.
You interview other people and they assert your assumption that the wait time is longer than 7-8 minutes. 
To convince yourself, you also call the bus operator and get data on frequency of your buss stop. 
You discover that busses are punctual, indeed. What is happening? According to busses data, wait time
should be close to 7 minutes, where as your survey reports as close to 14minutes average wait time. 
That is double the amount of time. How come? There is a sampling bias happening here. 

This is known as the inspection paradox. What happens in reality is that you oversample people that have
waited for longer, just due to the fact that people that caught the bus on time are smaller than people who
accumulated through waiting. This simple observation is key to this paradox. 

Another example are class sizes in a university campus. If you take the mean from what is reported by students
it will be different from what is reported by the university. This is because most classes have 100+ students,
and there are some classes with less than 10 people that you will not sample from. 
 
An intuitive way to understand this paradox is that if you have 2 classes A and B, with 100 and 5 people respectively,
in total you have 105 students. However, when you survey, you need to notice that out of 105 students, 100 (coming from class A)
also have 100 students, in their class. So, proportionally you are more likely to sample those people and report the average
as 100, where in fact it should be 52.5. That is an extreme case, but hopefully it made it clearer. 

The interesting thing about this paradox is that we can recover the "true" distribution from the biased one (or at least approximate).
The function defined below, tries to do exactly that, get a survey and sample from that very survey with weights proportional to the 
sample itself. If you now resample with weights inverse of what your survey suggested you should get an approximation of the true 
population. The justification of why the inverse of the biases work is that you account that you might be oversampling so you 
give it less weight in the denominator, this makes the `choice` function to overcompensate and oversample the rarer events. 

{% highlight python linenos %}
def resample(sample, weights):
    n = len(sample)
    w = weights / weights.sum()
    return np.random.choice(sample, n, p=w)

true_data = np.random.exponential(7.5, size=1000) # we do not know this

biased = resample(true_data, true_data) # we sample from the true data here (surveying)
inferred = resample(biased, 1/biased)
{% endhighlight %}
