This post is going to be easy and fast. I am going to talk about the mean function. Traditionally said to be:

$$\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i $$

This is known as the mean, or more specifically the arithmetic mean. However, there are also other measure of centrality (i.e. mean), like  
the geometric mean. This is exactly what it sounds. If you have a arbitrary box with sides: 2 units height, 1 length and 5 depth, we ask: "What is the 
side of the cube that would hold the same volume as this box?" The answer is the cube with side equal to the geometric mean of the 3 sides of the original box.
Formally states as:

$$ (\prod_{i=1}^{n} x_i)^\frac{1}{n} = \sqrt[\leftroot{10} \uproot{5} n]{x_1 \cdot x_2 \cdot ... \cdot x_n} $$

The volume of the box is 10 units, so the cube that has the same volume should have side $$ a = \sqrt[\leftroot{10} \uproot{5} 3]{10} $$.
The premise behind the geometric mean is that you need to find the square/cube/hypercube that approximates the volume of the 
given side measures. 

This is useful in finance where it describes proportional growth, rather than the arithmetic mean which is more suited
as a linear average growth measure. What does this mean? Try to use geometric means whenever you have compounding effect of percentages.
It will better describe the average proportional growth.
