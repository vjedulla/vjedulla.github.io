Hello world!

I am Mando and I'm a junior Data Scientist in a company based in Brussels, Belgium. This blog was made for the purposes of trying to become better at
putting my thoughts into writing. The goal will be towards Data Science topics, talks, snippets and many more things I am interested in.
That is to say `statistics`, `optimization algorithms` and `graphs`. These are the building blocks to a lot of the algorithms we have at our disposal
in scikit-learn and on other packages. 


In the future I intend to also write about deep learning and neural networks in general, but that day is far from now as I: 1) not good at all with those 
topics, 2) they feel a bit rushed when I do not have a conceptual grasp of the basics yet. 





<!-- You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight python %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
