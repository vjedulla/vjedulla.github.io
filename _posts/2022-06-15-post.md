This post is going to be easy and fast. I am going to talk about the mean function. Traditionally said to be:

$$\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i $$

This is known as the mean, more specifically the arithmetic mean. However, there are also other means:
1. Harmonic mean
2. Geometric mean

#### Harmonic mean
pass

#### Geometric mean
This is exactly what it sounds. If you have a box with sizes: 2 units height, 1 length and 5 depth, what is a cube
that would hold the same volume as this box? The answer is the cube with side geometric mean ([2, 1, 5]):

$$ (\prod_{i=1}^{n} x_i)^\frac{1}{n} = \sqrt[\leftroot{10} \uproot{5} n]{x_1 \cdot x_2 \cdot ... \cdot x_n} $$
