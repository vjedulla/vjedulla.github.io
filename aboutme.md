Hey there, I'm Armando, but you can call me Mando. Welcome to my corner of the internet!
Currently, I'm part of the talented team at [Jetpack.AI](https://jetpack.ai/){:target="_blank"}. Beyond the realm of data, I find inspiration in various hobbies such as films, and photography.


### My Journey

This blog is dedicated to sharing my journey as a Data Scientist. My goal is to bridge my gap between theory and practical application. As I continue to learn and grow, I want to share practical insights and useful methods, algorithms and more, that go beyond just the theoretical knowledge.

### Background and Experience

I hold a master's degree in __Computer Science: Data Science__ and also have the __AWS Solution Architect Associate__ certification under my belt. In my previous roles, I've had the opportunity to work with clients like *Unilever*, *RESA*, and *Brussels Airport*, where I focused on both Data Science and Engineering projects.
