My name is Armando Alliu but everyone calls me Mando.

Data Scientist @ [Jetpack.AI](https://jetpack.ai/){:target="_blank"}. 


My personal goal here is achieving in depth knowledge about statistics, optimization, graph theory, and various cloud architectures. Currently,
I hold a degree in Data Science, and the AWS Solution Architect certification. Past work experiences have guided me also towards
Data Engineering where notably I have worked with clients as Unilever and RESA. 


Based in Brussels, Belgium. Passion for science, films and photography. If you like any of my posts or just want to say hi,
hit me up via my social links on the footer of this page.
