My name is Armando, but everyone calls me Mando.

Data Scientist @ [Jetpack.AI](https://jetpack.ai/){:target="_blank"}. 

Based in Brussels, Belgium. Passion for science, films and photography. If you like any of my posts or just want to say hi,
hit me up via my social links on the footer of this page.


    The blog is dedicated to my journey as a Data Scientist. My personal goal here is to fill the gap 
    from my theoretical knowledge, to practical and useful application. Currently, I hold a masters degree in Data Science, and the 
    AWS Solution Architect certification. Past work experiences were focused towards Data Science/Engineering where notably I 
    have worked with clients as Unilever and RESA.
