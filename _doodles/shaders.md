# Introduction
This is a simple start towards learning shaders. This is a glitch effect. I know nothing of these and I was experimenting with [tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5YkU5Xu4_E&ab_channel=BarneyCodes){:target="_blank"} on youtube.

Draw with your mouse to see the glitch effect.
